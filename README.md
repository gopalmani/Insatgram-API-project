# Insatgram-API-project
This project provides you an interface to fetch images from the any location. 
For this project you need to have backend server running(I used Apache server http://localhost).
This project is done in PHP, but you can do it in any language able to handle HTTP request. "Get" request is used as the method of the request.
HTML5, CSS and JS are used for animation, designing and form layout. Googleanalytics data is used for map representation and pointer.
